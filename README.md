# **Healthcare with AI/ML** ðŸ¥¼ðŸ¤–

## **Idea Discription**

The core concept of this idea is to digitalise and automate the `Heathcare Ecosystem`.

There are many disadvantages in the current ecosystem
--

    - Non digitalize Personal Health Record.
    - Scattered Health record data.
    - No predictions from the available data.
    - No past records available to heath centers.
    - Wrong diagnoses and treatments due to lack of knowledge of patient history.
    - Insurance of many people becomes null and void due to unexpected diseases and taking up the wrong insurance which don't cover that disease.

## **What are we proposing?!**

Let us define the terms what we will going to use in the further documentation.

1. **PHR** (Personal Heath Record)
    - It will be a digitalized version of personal report of individuals.
    - It will contains **past** and **current** diseases and treatments of patients.
    - It will use by the users/patients to track thier heath record.

2. **EHR** (Electronic Health Record)
    - It will be a digitalized version of patients health care life.
    - Along with **PHR** it will also contains:
        - **Future predictions** of the diseases based on symptoms.
        - Prediction of the treatment based upon the past diagnoses.
    - It will be used by Health care providers.
